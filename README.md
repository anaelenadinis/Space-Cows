# Space-Cows-
This program is part of the Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science course on edX. Firstly, it uses a greedy heuristic to determine an allocation of cows that attempts to minimize the number of spaceship trips needed to transport all the cows. Secondly, it uses a brute force algorithm that finds the optimal solution.
